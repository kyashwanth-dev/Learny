# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform ideal for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka manages publish-and-subscribe messaging systems with high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## Features
- **High Throughput**: Can process millions of messages per second.
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Replication and data durability ensure resilience.
- **Scalable**: Partitioned and distributed across brokers.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Integrates with stream processing frameworks.

## Sample Use Cases
- Log aggregation
- Event sourcing
- Real-time analytics
- Stream processing

## Example
See `producer_example.py` for a simple Python Kafka producer using kafka-python.
