# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool designed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

## Features

- **Multi-cloud support**: Manage resources on different cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Describe your infrastructure in code, enabling easy versioning and replication.
- **Execution Plans**: Preview changes before applying them, ensuring infrastructure modifications are predictable.
- **Resource Graph**: Automatically constructs dependency graphs and optimizes resource creation and destruction.
- **Modular & Reusable**: Organize configurations into reusable modules.

## Sample Use Case

Consider an organization that needs to consistently provision and update cloud resources for development, staging, and production environments. Using Terraform, they can write, version control, and safely apply configuration files to deploy EC2 instances, databases, and networking resources across AWS accounts with minimal manual effort.
